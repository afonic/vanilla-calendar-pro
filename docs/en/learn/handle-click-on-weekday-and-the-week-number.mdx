# Handling Day of Week and Week Number Clicks

## Day of the Week

You can intercept a click on a day of the week and, for example, select all days of the month that correspond to that day of the week.

<Sandbox example="handle-click-on-weekday" />

## Week Number

You can display week numbers in the calendar using the `enableWeekNumbers` parameter and handle clicks on them. Having information about the dates in the selected week, you can easily select these dates in the same way.
