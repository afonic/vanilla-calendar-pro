# Handling Day Click

For user interaction with the calendar, various actions are provided, one of which is `onClickDate()`. This action allows you to track when a user clicks on a specific day in the calendar.

Example with outputting the selected day to the console:

<Sandbox example="handle-click-a-day" />

Note that the selected day is represented as an array, as the user can select not only a single day but also a range of dates if allowed by the calendar parameters.

<Sandbox example="handle-click-a-day-ranged" />
