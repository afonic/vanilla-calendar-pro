# Themes

The calendar supports custom themes and by default has light and dark themes.

If the `themeAttrDetect` parameter is set to `false`, the theme will be determined by the user's system settings or the `selectedTheme` parameter.

The calendar can automatically detect and track the site's theme based on the set tag and attribute. Additional information about this parameter can be found in the reference guide.

If your site supports only one theme or you want to customize the appearance of the calendar to your liking, you can explicitly select one of the available themes.

The example below demonstrates the forced use of the dark theme:

<Sandbox example="additional-features-themes-dark" themeDetection={false} />

And here is the same example, but using the light theme:

<Sandbox example="additional-features-themes-light" themeDetection={false} />

As described above, you can use your own themes, create them yourself, or import them from the calendar if they exist.

<Sandbox example="additional-features-themes-slate-light" themeDetection={false} />
