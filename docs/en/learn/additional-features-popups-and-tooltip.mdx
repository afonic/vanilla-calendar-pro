# Popups and Tooltips

## Popups

The calendar allows you to add popups with information for any day, which will be displayed when hovering over that day.

In the provided example, a specific day is highlighted using a CSS modifier, and information is added to the popup.

Additional details about popups can be found in the reference guide.

## Tooltips

Tooltips can be used when the `selectionDatesMode` parameter is set to `'multiple-ranged'`. Using `onCreateDateRangeTooltip`, you can create a fully customized tooltip.
