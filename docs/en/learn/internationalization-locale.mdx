# Localization

If your locale is supported by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">`.toLocaleString()`</a> method, you can simply pass it to the `locale` parameter to localize the calendar.

If the locale is not supported or translated incorrectly, you can always set the locale manually. To do this, you need to provide arrays of month and weekday names instead of the language tag.
