# First Day of the Week and Weekends

By default, the calendar is based on the European standard **ISO 8601**. This means that the first day of the week is Monday.

Using separate parameters to define the first day of the week and the displayed weekends, you can specify any day as the first day of the week and assign any days of the week as weekends or completely disable them by specifying an empty array.
