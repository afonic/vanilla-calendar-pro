# Maximum and Minimum Date

The date range in the calendar can be set using the `dateMin` and `dateMax` parameters. These parameters specify the allowed range of dates in the calendar.

By default, the minimum date is `'1970-01-01'`, which corresponds to the beginning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNIX time</a>.
The maximum date is set to `'2470-12-31'` by default and is chosen arbitrarily.

If you need to set a specific range of possible dates, replace the values of the `dateMin` and `dateMax` parameters with the dates you need. Note that the calendar will not process dates outside the specified range.
