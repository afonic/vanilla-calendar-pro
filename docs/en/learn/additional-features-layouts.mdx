# Layouts

The calendar provides a convenient way to customize the HTML markup using the `layouts` parameter. This allows you to add your own elements, such as buttons or any other HTML element, to the calendar.

`layouts` takes the `type` of the calendar as the key and a string as the value.

In the following example, the calendar header is customized for `type: 'default'`, and a regular button is added inside the calendar.

<Sandbox example="additional-features-layouts" />

Now, let's use the `inputMode: true` parameter. We will add a button that will hide the calendar when clicked.

<Sandbox example="additional-features-layouts-btn-close" input={true} />
