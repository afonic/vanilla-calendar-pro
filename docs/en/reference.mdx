# Guide Overview

This section provides detailed documentation on working with the **Vanilla Calendar Pro API**. If you're looking for an introduction to the features, please check out the [«Learn»](/docs/learn) section.

The Vanilla Calendar Pro API documentation is divided into several functional subsections:

1. **Instance Creation** — how and where to create a calendar instance;
2. **Methods** — available methods for working with the calendar instance;
3. **Settings** — all options that can be provided to change the behavior and display of the calendar.
4. **Actions** — event handlers that allow you to receive and process various interaction data with the calendar.
5. **Popups** — pop-ups allow you to select any day and display brief information about it directly in the calendar when hovering over that day.
6. **Layouts** — templates that allow you to practically alter the entire DOM structure of the calendar and add your own HTML elements.
7. **Styles** — a CSS class object for styling the calendar. It allows you to use any CSS framework, like Tailwind CSS, or custom classes.
8. **Aria-labels** — an object of strings for `aria-label`. Allows you to localize all calendar labels to ensure accessibility.
